# [Commentcode API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentcode-api/) #

### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Commentcode API is an open source WordPress plugin that lets you generate custom outputs with HTML comment like codes.  

It is similar to the [shortcode API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) except it takes a form of HTML comments.

This way even the user disables your plugin, the embedded code will not be visible, on contrary to shortcodes that remain in posts when their plugins are deactivated. 


## Installation ##

- The latest development version can be found [here](https://github.com/michaeluno/commentcode-api/branches). 
- The latest stable version can be downloaded [here](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/commentcode-api.latest-stable.zip).

1. Upload **`commentcode-api.php`** and other files compressed in the zip folder to the **`/wp-content/plugins/`** directory.,
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

## Usage ##
<h4>Register a Commentcode</h4>
Use the `add_filter()` function with the filter name of `commentcode_tag_{your commentcode tag name}`.
```php
function get_my_commentcode( $arguments ) {
    return "<pre>" . htmlspecialchars( print_r( $arguments, true ) ) . "</pre>";
}
add_filter( 'commentcode_tag_' . 'my_commentcode', 'get_my_commentcode' );
```

For a test, while running the above code, try inserting `<!---my_commentcode Foo="bar" numbers[ 1 ]="one" numbers[ 2 ]="two"--->` in a post.

It will produce this output,
```
Array
(
    [Foo] => bar
    [numbers] => Array
        (
            [0] => one
            [1] => two
        )

)
```
