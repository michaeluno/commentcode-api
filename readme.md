# [Commentcode API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentcode-api/) #

### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Commentcode API is an open source WordPress plugin that lets you generate custom outputs with HTML comment like codes.  

It is similar to the [shortcode API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) except it takes a form of HTML comments.

This way even the user disables your plugin, the embedded code will not be visible, on contrary to shortcodes that remain in posts when their plugins are deactivated.
